# SPROUT Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Code of Conduct.

As stewards of the SPROUT (Speech Production Repository for Optimizing Use for AI Technologies) dataset, we are particularly committed to ethical research practices, responsible data use, and protecting the privacy and dignity of the children and families whose voices contribute to this research.

## Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our community's expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each other and act in ways that center our shared values, including:

1. **Respecting the purpose of our community**: Supporting ethical AI development for child speech assessment while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and consent.
2. **Engaging kindly and honestly** with other researchers, contributors, and community members.
3. **Respecting different viewpoints and experiences**, particularly regarding cultural and linguistic diversity in speech development.
4. **Taking responsibility for our actions and contributions**, especially regarding data use and research ethics.
5. **Gracefully giving and accepting constructive feedback** on research methods and findings.
6. **Committing to repairing harm when it occurs**, particularly when research practices may inadvertently cause harm.
7. **Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain** the well-being of our research community and the broader community we serve.

## Restricted Behaviors

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of Conduct.

1. **Harassment**: Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
2. **Character attacks**: Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people.
3. **Stereotyping or discrimination**: Characterizing anyone's personality or behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
4. **Sexualization**: Behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.
5. **Violating confidentiality**: Sharing or acting on someone's personal or private information without their permission.
6. **Endangerment**: Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm toward any person or group.
7. **Behaving in other ways that threaten** the well-being of our community.

### Additional Restrictions for Research Context

1. **Misleading identity**: Impersonating someone else for any reason, or pretending to be someone else to evade enforcement actions.
2. **Failing to credit sources**: Not properly crediting the sources of content, research, or data you contribute.
3. **Misuse of research data**: Using SPROUT data or derivatives outside the bounds of ethical research practices or data governance policies.
4. **Promotional materials**: Sharing marketing or other commercial content in a way that is outside the norms of the research community.
5. **Irresponsible communication**: Failing to responsibly present research content or findings, particularly those involving child participants.

## Reporting an Issue

Tensions can occur between community members even when they are trying their best to collaborate. Not every conflict represents a code of conduct violation, and this Code of Conduct reinforces encouraged behaviors and norms that can help avoid conflicts and minimize harm.

When an incident does occur, it is important to report it promptly. To report a possible violation, please contact us at **pedzstarlab@northwestern.edu**.

Community Moderators from the PedzSTAR Lab take reports of violations seriously and will make every effort to respond in a timely manner. They will investigate all reports of code of conduct violations, reviewing messages, logs, and recordings, or interviewing witnesses and other participants. Community Moderators will keep investigation and enforcement actions as transparent as possible while prioritizing safety and confidentiality.

## Addressing and Repairing Harm

If an investigation by the Community Moderators finds that this Code of Conduct has been violated, the following enforcement ladder may be used to determine how best to repair harm, based on the incident's impact on the individuals involved and the community as a whole. Depending on the severity of a violation, lower rungs on the ladder may be skipped.

### 1. Warning
- **Event**: A violation involving a single incident or series of incidents.
- **Consequence**: A private, written warning from the Community Moderators.
- **Repair**: Examples of repair include a private written apology, acknowledgement of responsibility, and seeking clarification on expectations.

### 2. Temporarily Limited Activities
- **Event**: A repeated incidence of a violation that previously resulted in a warning, or the first incidence of a more serious violation.
- **Consequence**: A private, written warning with a time-limited cooldown period designed to underscore the seriousness of the situation and give the community members involved time to process the incident.
- **Repair**: Examples of repair may include making an apology, using the cooldown period to reflect on actions and impact, and being thoughtful about re-entering community spaces after the period is over.

### 3. Temporary Suspension
- **Event**: A pattern of repeated violation which the Community Moderators have tried to address with warnings, or a single serious violation.
- **Consequence**: A private written warning with conditions for return from suspension, including potential restriction from data access.
- **Repair**: Examples of repair include respecting the spirit of the suspension, meeting the specified conditions for return, and being thoughtful about how to reintegrate with the community when the suspension is lifted.

### 4. Permanent Ban
- **Event**: A pattern of repeated code of conduct violations that other steps on the ladder have failed to resolve, or a violation so serious that the Community Moderators determine there is no way to keep the community safe with this person as a member.
- **Consequence**: Access to all community spaces, tools, datasets, and communication channels is removed permanently.
- **Repair**: There is no possible repair in cases of this severity.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to the use of SPROUT datasets and any derivatives, regardless of the context in which they are used.
